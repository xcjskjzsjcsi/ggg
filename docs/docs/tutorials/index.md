# Tutorials

Welcome to the LangGraph Tutorials! These notebooks introduce LangGraph through building various language agents and applications.

## Quick Start

Learn the basics of LangGraph through a comprehensive quick start in which you will build an agent from scratch.

- [Quick Start](introduction.ipynb)

## Use cases

Learn from example implementations of graphs designed for specific scenarios and that implement common design patterns.

#### Chatbots

- [Customer Support](customer-support/customer-support.ipynb): Build a customer support chatbot to manage flights, hotel reservations, car rentals, and other tasks
- [Prompt Generation from User Requirements](chatbots/information-gather-prompting.ipynb): Build an information gathering chatbot
- [Code Assistant](code_assistant/langgraph_code_assistant.ipynb): Build a code analysis and generation assistant

#### Multi-Agent Systems

- [Network](multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration.ipynb): Enable two or more agents to collaborate on a task
- [Supervisor](multi_agent/agent_supervisor.ipynb): Use an LLM to orchestrate and delegate to individual agents
- [Hierarchical Teams](multi_agent/hierarchical_agent_teams.ipynb): Orchestrate nested teams of agents to solve problems

#### RAG

- [Adaptive RAG](rag/langgraph_adaptive_rag.ipynb)
    - [Adaptive RAG using local LLMs](rag/langgraph_adaptive_rag_local.ipynb)
- [Agentic RAG](rag/langgraph_agentic_rag.ipynb)
- [Corrective RAG](rag/langgraph_crag.ipynb)
    - [Corrective RAG using local LLMs](rag/langgraph_crag_local.ipynb)
- [Self-RAG](rag/langgraph_self_rag.ipynb)
    - [Self-RAG using local LLMs](rag/langgraph_self_rag_local.ipynb)
- [SQL Agent](sql-agent.ipynb)

#### Planning Agents

- [Plan-and-Execute](plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute.ipynb): Implement a basic planning and execution agent
- [Reasoning without Observation](rewoo/rewoo.ipynb): Reduce re-planning by saving observations as variables
- [LLMCompiler](llm-compiler/LLMCompiler.ipynb): Stream and eagerly execute a DAG of tasks from a planner

#### Reflection & Critique 

- [Basic Reflection](reflection/reflection.ipynb): Prompt the agent to reflect on and revise its outputs
- [Reflexion](reflexion/reflexion.ipynb): Critique missing and superfluous details to guide next steps
- [Language Agent Tree Search](lats/lats.ipynb): Use reflection and rewards to drive a tree search over agents
- [Self-Discover Agent](self-discover/self-discover.ipynb): Analyze an agent that learns about its own capabilities

#### Evaluation

- [Agent-based](chatbot-simulation-evaluation/agent-simulation-evaluation.ipynb): Evaluate chatbots via simulated user interactions
- [In LangSmith](chatbot-simulation-evaluation/langsmith-agent-simulation-evaluation.ipynb): Evaluate chatbots in LangSmith over a dialog dataset

#### Experimental

- [Web Research (STORM)](storm/storm.ipynb): Generate Wikipedia-like articles via research and multi-perspective QA
- [TNT-LLM](tnt-llm/tnt-llm.ipynb): Build rich, interpretable taxonomies of user intentand using the classification system developed by Microsoft for their Bing Copilot application.
- [Web Navigation](web-navigation/web_voyager.ipynb): Build an agent that can navigate and interact with websites
- [Competitive Programming](usaco/usaco.ipynb): Build an agent with few-shot "episodic memory" and human-in-the-loop collaboration to solve problems from the USA Computing Olympiad; adapted from the ["Can Language Models Solve Olympiad Programming?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10952v1) paper by Shi, Tang, Narasimhan, and Yao.
- [Complex data extraction](extraction/retries.ipynb): Build an agent that can use function calling to do complex extraction tasks
