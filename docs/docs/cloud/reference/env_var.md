# Environment Variables

The LangGraph Cloud API supports specific environment variables for configuring a deployment.

## `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE`

Sampling rate for traces sent to LangSmith. Valid values: Any float between `0` and `1`.

See <a href="https://docs.smith.langchain.com/how_to_guides/tracing/sample_traces" target="_blank">LangSmith documentation</a> for more details.

## `LANGGRAPH_AUTH_TYPE`

Type of authentication for the LangGraph Cloud API deployment. Valid values: `langsmith`, `noop`.

For deployments to LangGraph Cloud, this environment variable is set automatically. For local development or deployments where authentication is handled externally (e.g. self-hosted), set this environment variable to `noop`.

## `N_JOBS_PER_WORKER`

Number of jobs per worker for the LangGraph Cloud task queue. Defaults to `10`.
